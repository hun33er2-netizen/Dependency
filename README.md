# Dependency Confusion Finder (Prototype)

This repository contains a Python prototype for detecting dependency confusion vulnerabilities
(across npm and PyPI in this minimal version).

Contents:
- dep_confusion.py — prototype scanner (npm + PyPI minimal implementation)
- README.md — this file

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.8+
- pip install requests

Quick start (prototype)
-----------------------
Clone or copy the repository, then run:

```bash
pip install requests
python dep_confusion.py --project /path/to/project --format text
```

Notes
-----
- /path/to/project should be the project root (repository root). The scanner looks for:
  - npm: package.json and package-lock.json
  - PyPI: requirements.txt
- To scan a GitHub repo in CI, run the scanner after checkout in the workspace.
- This is a prototype. Additional ecosystem parsers, registry clients, heuristics,
  CI wrappers, SARIF output, and tests are planned (see roadmap).
